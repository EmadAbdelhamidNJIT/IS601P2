                    No, it is communication!
                    From previous article you know how www has changed the world. Now let us focus how the world has
                    changes the www.
                    Chad hurly, introduced YouTube so you can broadcast yourself without limitation posed by some
                    powerful people in terms of what you can see or listen on tv. Everyone has their own broadcasting
                    tower from there they can share whatever information they require. This seems threatening to some
                    industries established players.

                <p class="card-text" align="left">Just like YouTube, dig is doing the same thing but for news. Digg
                    operates under a very simple methodology. Users submit (or "digg") web pages or blog posts they like
                    by entering the URL for the specific page as well as a short description and selecting a category
                    that page fits in. Each submission is open for all Digg users to view through the "Upcoming
                    Articles" page. Other users can then digg or "bury" those submissions (or completely ignore them).
                    Submissions that get a lot of diggs will appear on the main page of the Digg website within the list
                    of "Popular Articles" where other Digg users can find them and click on the links to visit the
                    original articles.
                    Another revolutionary contribution was mp3. No one imagined we can play music on computer. By
                    inventing winamp, it became more convenient to use mp3 file format songs.
                    Napster is a set of three music-focused online services developed by Shawn Fanning. It was founded
                    in 1999 as a pioneering peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing Internet software that emphasized sharing
                    digital audio files, typically audio songs, encoded in MP3 format. As the software became popular,
                    the company ran into legal difficulties over copyright infringement.
                    The next big thing was facebook. It has the potential to become the windows of social media. The
                    competitior to this is MySpace.

                <p class="card-text" align="left">While both Facebook and MySpace, the world's most popular social
                    networking sites, support the human social tendency, they have done so by paths that have attracted
                    very different audiences. Their slogans make the difference in approach clear. Facebook's promise is
                    that it "helps you connect and share with the people in your life". The point here is that you
                    already have a social network. Facebook exists only to support communication with the people in it.
                    Compare this to the MySpace slogan: "A place for friends". The difference is subtle but significant.
                    While Facebook is a tool intended to support communication and networking, MySpace is a thing, a
                    place, a new hangout site â€“ a kind of virtual alternative to the mall beloved by teenagers.
