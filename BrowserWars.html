                <p class="card-text" align="left">The first web browser, World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee
                    who also
                    invented the World wide web. Further, next year many other browsers for different platforms came
                    out. These browsers were only simple HTML-Viewers software. In 1993, the Mosaic web browser was
                    developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of
                    Illinois. Despite many web browsers coming at that time, Mosaic was the most influential because its
                    features were better. It was based on the libwww library.
                    The popularity of the Mosaic was at the peak, but one of its developers, Marc Andreessen met with
                    Jim Clark of silicon graphics. After his graduation from the University of Illinois, Andreessen and
                    Jim Clark founded Mosaic Communications Corporation in 1994. Because of the conflicts with the
                    University of Illinois, they changed the name to Netscape and thus released the Netscape navigator
                    0.9, a web browser. Andreessen was one of the co-developers of the Mosaic browser, and he knew what
                    was needed in the new browser they were working on. Thus, the Mosaic war started between the Mosaic
                    browser and the Netscape navigator. By the end of 1995, the web boom set by the mosaic was overtaken
                    by the Netscape navigator. The web was receiving a great amount of attention from the public and
                    media, which led Microsoft in the competition. Thus, leading to the first browser war.
                    The Netscape navigator was the sole dominant at that time after winning the mosaic war. Having the
                    monopoly at the time, Netscape offered its browser free for non-commercial users but demanded money
                    for a license. The IPO was extremely successful for Netscape and newly added features such as
                    frames, image maps, and JavaScript iterations were immensely influential.
                    For years, Microsoft had ignored the web and focused much on their platform. But soon bill gates
                    realized how the web is going to make a big impact on the future. Microsoft was already dominating
                    the operating system usage share with 90 percent, but Netscape was the one that dominated the web
                    browsers usage share with 80 percent. That means, if you are buying Microsoft windows, you need to a
                    web browser separately. First, Microsoft sent its engineers to Netscape for discussing the future of
                    Microsoft and the web. Things did not go well between Microsoft and Netscape, and after some time,
                    the two companies rarely spoke. The Netscapeâ€™s popularity was increasing and then, just after 15
                    days of that IPO launch, Microsoft had their own browser ready, the Internet Explorer. The first
                    version was not that impressive in the front of Netscape. However, in 1995, Microsoft launched
                    second version. After that it seem like full fledged war between these two. The third version of
                    Internet Explorer gave massive fight to Netscape but the market share for Netscape was too high to
                    get a dent from Microsoft.

                <p class="card-text" align="left">Then comes a turning point in this war when Microsoft launched
                    Internet Explorer 4.0, when Bill Gates provided the browser free of cost along with the Microsoft
                    Windows. Since Microsoft had major share of operating system market, it seriously damaged Netscape.
                    The popularity of Internet Explorer kept on rising and Netscape could not recover from there.
                    The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation in the early 1990s to determine whether
                    Microsoft was trying to create a monopoly. Although that investigation was closed, the Department of
                    Justice (DoJ) picked it up. On May 18, 1998, the DoJ and the attorneys general of 20 different
                    states filed antitrust charges against Microsoft to determine whether the company's bundling of
                    additional programs into its operating system constituted monopolistic actions. The suit was brought
                    following the browser wars that led to the collapse of Microsoft's top competitor, Netscape, which
                    occurred when Microsoft began giving away its browser software for free. The government case accused
                    Microsoft of making it difficult for consumers to install competing software on computers operated
                    by Windows. If Microsoft were found to have made it unreasonably difficult for consumers to
                    uninstall Internet Explorer and use a competing browser, the company's practices would be deemed
                    anti-competitive. The case meandered along with accusations of misleading statements and a variety
                    of courtroom distractions.
                    Despite the manipulated evidence in form of videos, facts and emails, Microsoft lost the case and it
                    was ordered to divide the company in half; one part as the operating system company and the one as
                    the software company. But Microsoft did not hold back and appealed the decision. Here the appeal
                    court overturned the earlier ruling and settled with Microsoft. This whole incident has left very
                    dark impact since it is seen as the favoritism to the big fish.
